            <p>Hello, my name is Kate Thompson, and I am a junior in the BSI program, studying User Experience design with a minor in graphic design. 
            </p>
            <p> Through my rigorous course load at UMSI thus far, I have honed my skills for information and strategic analysis in tandem with my 
                    graphic design abilities which allow me to look at a product or a problem from several different angles. I am passionate about creating 
                    products that are not only beautiful to look at but also catered to the needs of the user and a joy to engage with. I am a firm believer 
                    that both style and substance matter greatly, and I thrive in creative environments in which I'm asked to marry the two, especially when 
                    figuring out how to join them is a bit of a puzzle. I am in a class right now focusing on web design and development with a strong emphasis 
                    on accessibility, so I’m learning how the connection between a beautiful product and one that is easily accessible to all users can be slim. 
                    I am enjoying walking that line with my own portfolio that I am currently developing.
            </p>
            <p>Projects that are not only lovely in appearance but also transformative for its users excite me, and I know that (company XYZ) is seeking 
                    interns to fuel its innovation. I have the skills in graphic design and problem-solving, as well as the enthusiasm, to be an asset to your 
                    company from day one. If you have a minute, I would love to learn more about the types of projects your interns are involved in during their 
                    tenure at (XYZ).
            </p>
