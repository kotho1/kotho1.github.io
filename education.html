                        <p>Graphic Design is all around us! Words and pictures—the building blocks of graphic design—are the elements that carry the majority of the content in both the digital world and the printed world. As graphic design becomes more visible and prevalent in our lives, graphic design as a practice becomes more important in our culture.

                                Through visual examples, this course will teach you the fundamental principles of graphic design: imagemaking, typography, composition, working with color and shape... foundational skills that are common in all areas of graphic design practice. 
                                
                                At the end of this course you will have learned how to explore and investigate visual representation through a range of image-making techniques; understand basic principles of working with shape, color and pattern; been exposed to the language and skills of typography; and understand and have applied the principles of composition and visual contrast.</p>

                        <p>Typography is the art of manipulating the visual form of language to enrich and control its meaning. It’s an essential area of skill and knowledge for graphic designers. Typography predates modern graphic design by around 500 years; it is rich in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology—but it remains an exciting space for invention and expression.

                                In this rigorous introductory course, we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We’ll consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type. We’ll peek into the  rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of familiar typefaces. We’ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization. And we’ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type.</p>

                            Studio: 2D focuses on developing the basic visual skills used by artists and designers working creatively in two dimensions. Conceived as a broad-based, integrative approach to learning as well as making, this entry-level studio course sensitizes students to processes of visual perception, two-dimensional construction and its potential for visual expression and communication. Working with form, color, texture, and pattern, students are introduced to the form language, vocabulary, concepts, and principles associated with two-dimensional composition and construction.

                        <p>This course examines a series of dramatic transformations in French art between 1784 and 1907—from the rise of Neoclassicism and Romanticism to the advent of Realism, Impressionism, and Post-Impressionism. Our objective is to account for a selection of remarkable pictures (by David, Géricault, Courbet, Manet, Degas, Monet, Seurat, Cézanne, van Gogh, et. al.) and to assess the changing cultural circumstances under which the art of painting was produced.</p>

                        <p>This course will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to begin to address the key issues associated with the Information Revolution. Issues will range from the theoretical (what is information and how do humans construct it?), to the cultural (is life on the screen a qualitatively different phenomenon from experiences with earlier distance-shrinking and knowledge-building technologies such as telephones?), to the practical (what are the basic architecture of computing networks?). Successful completion of this "gateway" course will give you the conceptual tools for an initial understanding of the politics, economics, and culture of the Information Age, providing a foundation for later study in Information or any number of other disciplines. You will be more thoughtful about thorny information issues, and more "information literate" than you were before.</p>

                        <p>When you turn on the faucet at home, use a drinking fountain, or buy bottled water you expect the water to be free of harmful chemical or microbial contaminants.  But recent water quality disasters such as the Flint Water crisis indicate that even in the 21st-century drinking water sources may not always meet water quality standards if not engineered properly from source to user. Our engineering goals in this section are to gain a fundamental understanding of drinking water quality issues including contaminants of concern, their detection and health risks, and effective engineering approaches for removing them from water. First, you will pick a contaminant of interest, quantify its health risks, and learn simple field-test methods for its detection and quantification. Second, you will collect a water sample and measure the concentration of the contaminant. Finally, you will select an appropriate point of use device for removing the contaminant and demonstrate its effectiveness. 

                                In addition to the engineering content, you will study and practice written and oral communication in engineering contexts. Coursework will emphasize audience analysis, writing strategies, genres of technical discourse, visual communication, collaboration, and professional responsibility. We will also consider the ethical and social implications of engineering work, and how to address these topics in your writing and speaking practices. </p>

                        <p>The goal of this course is to provide an integrated overview of major topics in cognitive science. The study of mind and brain raises some of the deepest and most complex issues facing science, and no single discipline can lay claim to privileged status when it comes to making progress. Indeed, much of the recent excitement in the field has come from approaches that draw on the ideas and methods of multiple disciplines. In this course we'll get a taste of some of that excitement.

                                Topics covered in the course include: language, perception, rationality, decision-making, emotion, attention, and morality. With each topic, we will examine it across multiple levels: functional, psychological, computational, and neural. The aim is to arrive at an overview of the big ideas of cognitive science—the theoretical principles that constitute our current understanding of how our minds work.</p>

                        <p>Reason better when deciding what to believe, and when deciding what to do. This course provides the tools you need, drawing from several areas: cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, logic, probability, and decision theory. We will consider empirical evidence about 'heuristics and biases’—spontaneous judgments that can be predictably irrational. And we will study what good deductive, causal, and probabilistic reasoning looks like. But the goal is entirely practical: to develop effective reasoning skills with clear applications in your personal and professional lives.</p>

                        <p>In this course we will investigate ‘supernatural’ phenomena in the visual arts: divine acts, miracles, magic, and sorcery.  We will be interested in how and why people in late medieval and early modern Europe distinguished between the ‘supernatural’ and the ‘natural’, as well as the extreme fluidity of these terms.  We will investigate how certain ‘supernatural’ occurrences were considered to have been caused by God, saints, and holy men and women, while others were said to be the work of the devil, demons, sorcerers, witches, and tricksters. A variety of artistic media and genres will be studied: narrative paintings, prints, miraculous images, votive objects, relics and reliquaries, incantations, and prayers. We will also be interested in how conceptions about the miraculous and diabolical were applied to artists and to works of art: the ‘divine’ Michelangelo was compared to the supreme animator, God; figures of devils in paintings were defaced in order to prevent evil forces from acting through the images.  Our inquiry will extend beyond the boundaries of Europe and consider modern day experiences for comparative purposes.</p>
